# data_engineering

Welcome to my data engineering project! 
My goal with this project is to apply and demonstrate my skills in Python.

To run the program, clone this repository, download python 3.9 or later and check "add to path"
once python is in the environment path variable, open a terminal, cd into the repo and run 
"python -m pip install requirements.txt". 
Then run python plt_charts_and_graphs.py.
