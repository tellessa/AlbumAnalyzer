Welcome to my data engineering project!
My goal with this project is to apply and demonstrate my skills in Python, making requests to API's, and much more.

To run the program, clone this repository, download python 3.9 or later and check "add to path".
Once python is in the environment path variable, open a terminal, cd into the repo and run
"python -m pip install requirements.txt".
Then run python main_ui.
