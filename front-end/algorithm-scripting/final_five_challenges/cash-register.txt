Cash Register
Design a cash register drawer function checkCashRegister() that accepts purchase price as the first argument (price), payment as the second argument (cash), and cash-in-drawer (cid) as the third argument.

cid is a 2D array listing available currency.

The checkCashRegister() function should always return an object with a status key and a change key.

Return {status: "INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS", change: []} if cash-in-drawer is less than the change due, or if you cannot return the exact change.

Return {status: "CLOSED", change: [...]} with cash-in-drawer as the value for the key change if it is equal to the change due.

Otherwise, return {status: "OPEN", change: [...]}, with the change due in coins and bills, sorted in highest to lowest order, as the value of the change key.

Currency Unit	Amount
Penny	$0.01 (PENNY)
Nickel	$0.05 (NICKEL)
Dime	$0.1 (DIME)
Quarter	$0.25 (QUARTER)
Dollar	$1 (ONE)
Five Dollars	$5 (FIVE)
Ten Dollars	$10 (TEN)
Twenty Dollars	$20 (TWENTY)
One-hundred Dollars	$100 (ONE HUNDRED)
See below for an example of a cash-in-drawer array:

[
  ["PENNY", 1.01],
  ["NICKEL", 2.05],
  ["DIME", 3.1],
  ["QUARTER", 4.25],
  ["ONE", 90],
  ["FIVE", 55],
  ["TEN", 20],
  ["TWENTY", 60],
  ["ONE HUNDRED", 100]
]




    // 50 cents can be
    // one quarter, 5 nickels
    // quarter, 4 nickels, 5 pennies
    // algorithm outline:
    // 1. always prefer a higher denomination
    // set up a mapping to show the unitValue of each denomination- done
    // Disregard denominations that are in themselves greater than the required change
    //

    // Get the total value of cash in drawer
    // compare the change due to the total value of cash in drawer
    // check for 3 possible cases:
    // a. cidValue == changeDue
    // CLOSED
    // b. cidValue < changeDue
    // INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS
    // c. cidValue > changeDue
    // OPEN
